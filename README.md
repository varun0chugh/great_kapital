Single Page Application (SPA) built with React that functions as a job listing platform.|
1.The app uses Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes 
2.Fetches job data from a sample API and displays them in a card or grid format with details like title, company, location, salary range, and employment type.
3.Allows users to search for jobs by title or company name using a search bar in the header.
4.While not fully implemented yet, there's a foundation for filtering jobs by location, job category, and employment type. There's also a toggle to show only remote jobs.

setup-
1.Install Node.js and npm
2.Clone this code repository or download the code files.
3.Open a terminal in the project directory and run npm install
4.Start the development server by running npm start
